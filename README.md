# Chat-Logger-
ChatLogger++

A tool originally created by VoIdEd on FacePunch:

Since his repository is since deleted, I'm mirroring it here.

It still seems to work fine, except for the group chat and nickname support features.

I am not the creator and had no involvement in it's development. I'm simply reviving an otherwise dead utility.
