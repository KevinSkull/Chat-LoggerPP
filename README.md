# Chat-Logger-
ChatLogger++

A tool originally posted by VoIdEd on BitBucket:
https://bitbucket.org/VoiDeD/open-steamworks/downloads/Chat%C2%A0Logger%2B%2B%C2%A01.2.rar

It still seems to work fine, except for the group chat and nickname support features, so I decided to rehost it here after finding it on one of my backup drives from 2013.

I am not the creator and had no involvement in it's development. I'm simply reviving an otherwise dead utility.
