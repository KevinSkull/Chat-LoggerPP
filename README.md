# Chat-Logger-
ChatLogger++

A tool originally created by VoIdEd on FacePunch:
http://www.facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=840880

Since his repository is since deleted, I'm mirroring it here.

It still seems to work fine, except for the group chat and nickname support features.

I am not the creator and had no involvement in it's development. I'm simply reviving an otherwise dead utility.

If you're interested in reviving this project, VoIdEd seems to have posted the source on his own repo:
